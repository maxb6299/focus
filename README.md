# focus

Focus is a website for helping people with productivity. It contains:

- A Pomodoro timer (25 minutes for work and 5 minutes for break)
- An embedded Spotify playlist linking to classical music
- A work log. It contains a number (x/10) to quantify the quality of work. It also has a text box to write any notes about that work session
- A sign in feature (using Google sign-in) so all work logs and settings are be stored in a server and can be accessed anywhere
