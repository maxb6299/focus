Focus is a website for helping people with productivity. The goal was to make a minimal and distraction-free web application that still looked visually interesting. 

## Key Features

- A Pomodoro timer (a timer that has 25 minutes for work and 5 minutes for break)
- An embedded Youtube playlist linking to classical music
- A sign in feature (using Google sign-in) so the settings are stored in the cloud and can be accessed anywhere
- Settings menu that customizes: timer length(s), what music link is playing, overall appearance
- Mobile friendly
